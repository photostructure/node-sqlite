# TODO: @photostructure/sqlite

This document tracks the remaining tasks before releasing v1.0.0.

## âœ… Recently Completed

- âœ… **Worker thread support** - Full support with proper V8 isolate handling (see [WORKER-THREAD-SUPPORT.md](./WORKER-THREAD-SUPPORT.md))
  - Fixed static constructor issue causing HandleScope errors
  - Each worker thread gets its own isolated environment
  - 100% test success rate (was ~85% before fix)
  - No special initialization required
- âœ… **Hybrid ESM/CJS package** - Full dual-package support implemented
  - tsup configuration for modern build pipeline
  - Package.json exports field for proper module resolution
  - Tests run in both CJS and ESM modes
  - Simplified TypeScript configuration (from 6+ files to 3)

## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

- [x] **Upload prebuilds to GitHub releases** - Enable automatic distribution
