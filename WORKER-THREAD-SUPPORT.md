# Worker Thread Support Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement full Node.js worker thread support for @photostructure/sqlite.

## Current Status

**‚úÖ Partially Working:** The implementation has basic worker thread compatibility due to N-API and SQLite's multi-thread mode.  
**‚ùå Known Issue:** Worker threads currently cause segfaults (documented in TODO.md:186).  
**üìã Implementation Status:** Foundation is solid, but missing robust thread safety infrastructure.

## Research Summary

### SQLite Thread Safety Configuration

SQLite supports three threading modes:

- **Single-thread** (`SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0`): No thread safety, one thread only
- **Multi-thread** (`SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2`): Multiple threads, separate connections per thread ‚úÖ **CURRENT**
- **Serialized** (`SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1`): Full thread safety with mutexes (default)

**Current Configuration:** Using `SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2` (multi-thread mode) - the correct choice for worker threads where each thread gets its own database connection.

### Node.js Worker Thread Requirements for Native Addons

1. **Context-Aware Addons**: ‚úÖ N-API provides automatic context awareness
2. **Instance Data Management**: ‚ùå Missing `napi_set_instance_data` implementation
3. **Cleanup Hooks**: ‚ùå Missing `napi_add_env_cleanup_hook` for worker termination
4. **Connection Isolation**: ‚ùå No enforcement preventing cross-thread connection sharing
5. **Thread-Safe Functions**: ‚ùå Missing for advanced cross-thread communication

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Working Components:**

- N-API provides inherent context awareness across worker threads
- SQLite compiled with appropriate thread safety mode
- Basic ThreadPoolWork implementation in `src/shims/threadpoolwork-inl.h`
- Worker thread tests exist in `test/worker-threads-simple.test.ts`

**Missing Components:**

- Per-worker instance data management
- Cleanup hooks for worker thread lifecycle
- Validation preventing cross-thread object access
- Documentation for proper worker thread usage

**Known Issues:**

- Segfaults when using worker threads (TODO.md:186)
- Potential use-after-free scenarios in cross-thread contexts
- No cleanup when worker threads terminate

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Current Segfaults (High Priority - 1-2 days)

**Objective:** Resolve the known segfault issue preventing reliable worker thread usage.

**Tasks:**

1. **Debug worker thread segfaults**

   - Run existing tests in `test/worker-threads-simple.test.ts` under debugger
   - Identify specific crash locations using valgrind/gdb
   - Check for use-after-free in statement/database lifecycle

2. **Implement thread safety validation**

   - Add thread ID tracking to DatabaseSync and StatementSync objects
   - Validate that objects are only used from their creation thread
   - Throw clear errors for cross-thread usage attempts

3. **Fix statement/database lifecycle issues**
   - Ensure proper cleanup order when worker threads terminate
   - Add reference counting for cross-object dependencies
   - Test edge cases like closing database while statements exist

**Key Files to Modify:**

- `src/sqlite_impl.h` - Add thread ID tracking
- `src/sqlite_impl.cpp` - Add validation in all public methods
- `test/worker-threads-simple.test.ts` - Expand test coverage

**Expected Outcome:** Worker thread tests pass without segfaults.

### Phase 2: Robust Thread Support (Medium Priority - 1 day)

**Objective:** Implement proper per-worker instance data management and cleanup.

**Tasks:**

1. **Add instance data management**

   ```cpp
   // In binding.cpp
   struct AddonData {
     std::map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<DatabaseSync>> databases;
     std::mutex mutex; // For thread-safe access to shared state
   };

   // Set instance data during module initialization
   napi_set_instance_data(env, addon_data, cleanup_callback, nullptr);
   ```

2. **Implement cleanup hooks**

   ```cpp
   // Add cleanup hook for worker thread termination
   napi_add_env_cleanup_hook(env, worker_cleanup_callback, addon_data);
   ```

3. **Add connection isolation enforcement**
   - Track which thread created each database connection
   - Prevent sharing connections between worker threads
   - Add runtime validation for thread affinity

**Key Files to Modify:**

- `src/binding.cpp` - Add instance data and cleanup hooks
- `src/sqlite_impl.h` - Add thread affinity tracking
- `src/sqlite_impl.cpp` - Implement validation logic

**Expected Outcome:** Proper resource management and no memory leaks when worker threads terminate.

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing (Medium Priority - 1-2 days)

**Objective:** Provide comprehensive testing and usage documentation.

**Tasks:**

1. **Expand test coverage**

   - Add tests for multiple concurrent worker threads
   - Test worker thread creation/termination patterns
   - Test error scenarios (cross-thread usage, cleanup failures)
   - Add stress tests for worker thread pools

2. **Create usage documentation**

   - Document proper worker thread patterns
   - Provide example code for common use cases
   - Document limitations and best practices
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

3. **Add validation tests**
   - Test that cross-thread usage is properly prevented
   - Verify cleanup hooks work correctly
   - Test memory leak scenarios with valgrind

**Key Files to Create/Modify:**

- `test/worker-threads-advanced.test.ts` - Comprehensive worker thread tests
- `docs/WORKER-THREADS.md` - Usage documentation
- `README.md` - Add worker thread examples

**Expected Outcome:** Production-ready worker thread support with comprehensive documentation.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority - Future)

**Objective:** Add advanced worker thread capabilities.

**Tasks:**

1. **Thread-Safe Function support**

   - Implement `Napi::ThreadSafeFunction` for cross-thread callbacks
   - Add async callback mechanisms from worker threads
   - Support for progress notifications across threads

2. **Worker pool utilities**

   - Helper classes for managing worker thread pools
   - Load balancing for database operations
   - Connection pooling strategies

3. **Performance optimizations**
   - Optimize for multi-threaded scenarios
   - Reduce lock contention
   - Memory allocation optimizations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Thread Safety Model

**Connection Isolation Pattern** (Recommended):

- Each worker thread creates its own DatabaseSync instance
- No sharing of `sqlite3*` handles between threads
- Each thread's connections are completely independent

**Implementation Pattern:**

```javascript
// main.js
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");
const worker = new Worker("./worker.js", {
  workerData: { dbPath: "./data.db" },
});

// worker.js
const { DatabaseSync } = require("@photostructure/sqlite");
const { workerData } = require("worker_threads");

// Each worker creates its own connection
const db = new DatabaseSync(workerData.dbPath);
// ... perform operations
db.close(); // Clean up when done
```

### Memory Management Strategy

1. **Per-Worker Instance Data**:

   ```cpp
   struct WorkerData {
     napi_env env;
     std::vector<DatabaseSync*> databases;
     std::vector<StatementSync*> statements;
   };
   ```

2. **Cleanup Sequence**:

   - Worker thread termination triggers cleanup hook
   - All statements are finalized
   - All database connections are closed
   - Instance data is deallocated

3. **Reference Management**:
   - Use weak references where possible to prevent cycles
   - Track object dependencies for proper cleanup order
   - Implement RAII patterns for automatic cleanup

### Error Handling

**Cross-Thread Usage Detection**:

```cpp
class DatabaseSync {
  std::thread::id creation_thread_;

  void ValidateThread() {
    if (std::this_thread::get_id() != creation_thread_) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Database connection cannot be used from different thread");
    }
  }
};
```

**Error Categories**:

1. **Thread Affinity Errors**: Using objects from wrong thread
2. **Lifecycle Errors**: Using objects after worker termination
3. **Resource Errors**: Memory/handle leaks during cleanup

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

1. **Basic Functionality**:

   - Create database in worker thread
   - Execute SQL operations
   - Clean shutdown

2. **Concurrency Tests**:

   - Multiple workers accessing same file
   - Concurrent read/write operations
   - Worker thread pools

3. **Error Scenarios**:

   - Cross-thread usage attempts
   - Premature worker termination
   - Resource exhaustion

4. **Memory Tests**:
   - Valgrind leak detection
   - Stress testing with many workers
   - Long-running worker scenarios

### Test Files

- `test/worker-threads-simple.test.ts` - Basic functionality (exists)
- `test/worker-threads-advanced.test.ts` - Comprehensive scenarios (to create)
- `test/worker-threads-stress.test.ts` - Stress and performance tests (to create)
